        Media Acadamy <a href="https://plv.media">(plv.media)</a> is a program through my school district that teaches media creation in a close-to-industry manner.
        We livestream sports matches, create a news show, and do <b>plenty</b> of independent projects.
        At its core, media is very student-led organization, with our instructor Mrs. Hoch being the backbone of it all.
        <br>
        Media is very much like a family, and I'm incredibly fortunate that I get to be apart of it.
        It's brought a lot of joy and growth to my high school career, and I'll always be in debt to Mrs. Hoch for all the opportunities she has given me.

      <h2>What's my role in it?</h2>

        Well, a lot of things! I'm a very active member of the academy, and a lot of things go into that.
        <br>
        My most flashy and apparent contritubion was the creation of the <a href="https://plv.media/guide">PLV Media Guide</a>.
        Students who are in the program for all 4 years have a "capstone" project—something big to end off their career in the academy.
        Its common to start about a quarter or halfway into senior year. I started mine, the guide, the middle of my junior year,
        simply because of how large of an undertaking it is.
        <br>
        At the current moment of writing, the guide is already 56 pages long, and it's barely filled in. 
        I expect that by the end of my senior year it will be well over a hundred, if not multiple hundred, pages long.
        <br>
        Of course, I'm not writing it all by myself—we're a diverse group with plenty of branching skillsets, so we've brought on other members to write
        sections on their own specalties, who you can find in the "Contributions" section, and I'm very thankful for them.
        <br>
        <br>
        Beyond the guide, my main job is to handle both videoboards and the MOAC.
        The MOAC (Mother of All Cases) is the heart of our streams. It's a complex beast, as you can see from the picture above, and 
        I'm responsible for knowing how it works and keeping it working. I've been called out onto streams I'm not staffing to help plenty of times,
        and it's in part why I'm writing the guide, so that that knowledge won't be lost when I graduate.
        <br>
        I also had to create and teach a unit on the MOAC to the class. We have "mini-lessons" every tuesday and thursday, some of which I 
        teach for 15 minutes, other where I teach for the whole hour. It's a big learning expereince having to structure and teach 
        a unit of material, but it's been great fun!.
        <br><br>
        Lastly, I also do our gym videoboard. In our school gym we have a giant video-scoreboard that we can play videos on and do all sorts of
        fancy animations, and my job is to manage and operate it. There's not too much to say about it honestly, but it's been 
        a really cool job and even though the environment can be high-stress at times, it's something I've very much enjoyed.
