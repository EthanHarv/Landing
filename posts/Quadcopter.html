      <h1>What is an FPV quad?</h1>
      <p>
        First-person-view (FPV) quadcopters are a rather special type of drone - one where you get to experience flight with your own two eyes.
        These drones typically hit <i>much</i> higher speeds than your standard off-the-shelf drone, and so to control them, FPV pilots get a 
        special cockpit view where they can make lightning quick decisions. While some use this speed to have drone races, I'm on the side of the hobby that
        does "freestyle" - combining tricks together much like a skateboarder would.<br>
        To me, my FPV drone is a way to escape to the skys - it's a sensation like no other to feel like a bird, swooping and diving freely.<br>
        Learning to fly was a steep learning curve, but once I got it down, I was hooked, and I've been flying whenever I can since.
      </p>
      <h1>What was building it like?</h1>
      <p>
        I started researching quadcopters around mid-July 2020, and they <i>very</i> quickly took over a large portion of my time.
        Explaining all the various components of a quad is way beyond the scope of this quick overview, but for anyone interested,
        I'd recommend <a href="https://www.fpvknowitall.com/">Joshua Bardwell's site.</a> 
      </p>

      <p>
        My main gear is:<br>
        <code>
          - Eachine EV 800DM Goggles<br>
          - TX16S Radio Transmitter<br>
          - (Anniversary Edition) Martian 215 Carbon Fiber Frame<br>
          - Emax ECO Series 2306 2400KV Motors<br>
          - MAMBA F405 MK2 Flight Controller<br>
          - RunCam Phoenix 2 JB Edition<br>
          - RUSH Tiny Tany Mini vTx<br>
          - R-XSR Radio Reciever<br>
          - Dalprop Cyclone 5x4.6 Propellers<br>
          - VIFLY Finder V2 Buzzer<br>
        </code>
       All in, plus all of the batteries, chargers, etc. this first foray into quad building quickly wiped out my last year and half's worth of savings, 
       but I'd wager to say it was worth it. <br>
       It was incredibly satisfying putting it all together. I already had some previous soldering experience, but had never taken on 
       a project that required nearly as much - and with as much precision as this needed - so there was a definite learning curve. Slowly seeing my solder joints
       get better, going from questionable and just a bit lumpy to smooth and strong, felt amazing.<br>
       It took the better course of two days to troubleshoot everything and get it up in the air, but finally getting to fly it
       after all my months of prep was an experience like I've never had before. Flying around at breakneck speed, doing flips and rolls all over the place, 
       shooting up into the sky and looking down at myself - I truly felt like a bird.<br>

       Since then, I've been trying out all sorts of cool stuff with it. 
       I've been grabbing plenty of cool footage to use in broadcasting, as well as attempting some photogrammetry to get 3d models for use in animations. <br>
       It's been a fun process!

      <h1>Flight Footage!</h1>
      <p>
        I haven't uploaded many of my flights, but here are some of my first few ones.<br>
        <b>WARNING:</b> You should mute the first video! The second video is fine (and I'd actually recommend audio for), but the first one is from my goggle's DVR,
        which makes a horrible static sound the entire time.
